List your resource URIs and their corresponding brief descriptions. 
If you have a URI being used with multiple HTTP methods, 
you need to describe each pair of HTTP METHOD : URI separately. 

For example, if you have a resource URI as www.example.com/fish/types
and you have HTTP methods GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE to perform something
on that resource, you need to describe each pair of Method and URI briefly,
e.g., what GET www.example.com/fish/types does, 
what PUT www.example.com/fish/types does, 
what DELETE www.example.com/fish/types does, and so on.
